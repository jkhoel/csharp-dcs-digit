## Keybinds

Currently, the project does not support setting your own keybinds. This means that for this program to work, your DCS keybinds will have to be the following:

| DCS Keybind    | Modifier | Keyboard |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| ICP - 0        | LCtrl    | Num0     |
| ICP - 1        | LCtrl    | Num1     |
| ICP - 2        | LCtrl    | Num2     |
| ICP - 3        | LCtrl    | Num3     |
| ICP - 4        | LCtrl    | Num4     |
| ICP - 5        | LCtrl    | Num5     |
| ICP - 6        | LCtrl    | Num6     |
| ICP - 7        | LCtrl    | Num7     |
| ICP - 8        | LCtrl    | Num8     |
| ICP - 9        | LCtrl    | Num9     |
| ICP - RET      | LCtrl    | Left     |
